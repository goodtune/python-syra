This is a Python client for the Syra SOAP API. It attempts to make
working with the API feel pythonic, returning lists and dictionaries
in place of the native SOAP responses.

Note that there is no validation at present, this is a very simple
implementation that assumes you can perform the API calls you attempt.

A future version will probably provide better handling of failures.
